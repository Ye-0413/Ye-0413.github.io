abstract: 'In virtual reality, point-and-teleport (P&T) is a locomotion technique
  that is popular for its user-friendliness, lowering workload and mitigating cybersickness.
  However, most P&T schemes use instantaneous transitions, which has been known to
  hinder spatial learning. While replacing instantaneous transitions with animated
  interpolations can address this issue, they may inadvertently induce cybersickness.
  To counter these deficiencies, we propose Traceable Teleportation (TTP), an enhanced
  locomotion technique grounded in a theoretical framework that was designed to improve
  spatial learning. TTP incorporates two novel features: an Undo-Redo mechanism that
  facilitates rapid back-and-forth movements, and a Visualized Path that offers additional
  visual cues. We have conducted a user study via a set of spatial learning tests
  within a virtual labyrinth to assess the effect of these enhancements on the P&T
  technique. Our findings indicate that the TTP Undo-Redo design generally facilitates
  the learning of orientational spatial knowledge without incurring additional cybersickness
  or diminishing sense of presence.'
