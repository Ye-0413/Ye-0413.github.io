*Abstract* In the evolving landscape of educational technology, Edu-
Metaversepresentsauniquetechnologicalplatformforcollaborativelearn-
ing (CL), which can be especially useful in distance learning settings. Re-
searchers have taken a keen interest in the potential of Edu-Metaverse
for enabling and improving CL; however, the effects of various factors
on CL behaviours and performance still need to be fully understood.
This study used a within-subjects design involving 32 participants (16
females and 16 males) to investigate how learners’ attributes and envi-
ronmental attributes affect CL in Edu-Metaverse. The participants were
randomly assigned to groups of four for a CL session in Edu-Metaverse.
The confirmatory factor analysis revealed that various behavioural met-
rics in Edu-Metaverse mediated the effects of trait anxiety and virtual
space satisfaction on CL performance; perceived understanding of mes-
sages, under the umbrella of social presence, also had a direct effect on
CL performance. These insights underscore the importance of optimising
