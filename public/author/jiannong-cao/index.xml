      <title>Knowledge-Graph-Driven Mind Mapping for Immersive Collaborative Learning: A Pilot Study in Edu-Metaverse</title>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the promises of edu-metaverse is its ability to provide a virtual environment that enables us to engage in learning activities that are similar to or on par with reality. The digital enhancements introduced in a virtual environment contribute to our increased expectations of novel learning experiences. However, despite its promising outcomes, there appears to be limited adoption of the edu-metaverse for practical learning at this time. We believe this can be attributed to the fact that there is a lack of investigation into learners’ behavior given a social learning environment. This lack of investigation is critical, as without behavioral insight, it hinders the development of education material and the direction of an edu-metaverse. Upon completing our work with the pilot user studies, we provide the following insights: 1) compared to Zoom, a typical video conferencing and remote collaboration platform, learners in the edu-metaverse demonstrate heightened involvement in learning activities, particularly when drawing mind mapping aided by the embedded knowledge graph, and this copresence signiﬁcantly boosts learner engagement and collaborative contribution to the learning tasks; and 2) the interaction and learning activity design within the edu-metaverse, especially concerning the use of MM.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>From classroom to metaverse: a study on gamified constructivist teaching in higher education</title>
      <link>http://localhost:57753/publication/ng-2023-classroom/</link>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the rapidly evolving educational landscape, the integration of metaverse and gamiﬁcation is emerging as a revolutionary approach. This paper presents the Gamiﬁed Constructivist Teaching in the Metaverse (GCTM) framework, aiming to enhance engagement and satisfaction in the computer science education domain. Implemented in two engineering classes using the metaverse platform, the GCTM model, with its unique combination of game world design, rule design, roleplay, mission assignments, and evaluation, demonstrated promising results in enhancing student-lecturer interactions. Feedback indicated a stronger sense of belonging among students in the virtual environment compared to conventional platforms like ZOOM or MS Teams. The ﬁndings underscore the potential of GCTM in transforming the educational experience, suggesting a signiﬁcant stride towards a more interactive and learner-centric approach in the metaverse-driven educational era.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Towards an edu-metaverse of knowledge: Immersive exploration of university courses</title>
      <link>http://localhost:57753/publication/sin-2023-towards/</link>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metaverse, an alternative universe for play, work and interaction, has become a captivating topic for academia and industry in recent times. This opens the question on what a metaverse for education, or edu-metaverse, should look like. It is believed that this metaverse for learning should be grounded by a pedagogical theory. Particularly, we propose a constructivist metaverse learning theory with eight actionable principles to guide the edu-metaverse and its applications. With this metaverse learning theory, we further propose the framework for an edu-metaverse; it is essentially walkable yellow pages that connect knowledge. The core idea is to combine the structure of knowledge graphs and the immersion of virtual reality in order to facilitate association, exploration and engagement in learning. Our current prototype for this edu-metaverse vision, K-Cube VR, is also presented. We have tested K-Cube VR for the introduction of course topics to our students and the results indicate that our edu-metaverse framework benefits students by providing a focused environment and structured learning on the topics of a course, akin to a mind map. Overall, in this paper, we present an edu-metaverse design that is rooted in a constructivist pedagogy that already shows promising results from a pilot user study via our metaverse prototype.&lt;/p&gt;
